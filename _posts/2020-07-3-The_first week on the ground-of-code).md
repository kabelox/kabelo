# The Introduction

Believe it or not during my weeks on lockdown I have been missing this place very much, most of the time being vivid about the axiom.

## The body

Monday when I came here something changed in me and I'm starting to take charge of my life right now, I mean who else knows, during this past days in this week I came 45 minutes prior to the TCG class starts depending on my cab sometimes even an hour early. Typing and learning javascript for me would not be a problem at all since I have been indulged in javascript books and typing games during this lockdown.I mean code is starting to grow on me, I believe soon code is going to be my second nature.

This week I have been busy with javascript and is a bit of a pain when it comes to making my static pages interactive when assimilating HTML along with Css, I mean the books only taught me all the fundamentals and concepts in javascript and now I'm trying to merge up all the wisdom the books gave me, to understand Javascript to the fullest.No idea why I'm so productive maybe is because I'm looking forward to 
learning my ultimate language Python or maybe this is the birth of an adult!


### Conclusion

Anyway, the week was awesome! met all of my family and some other new great people and Collen is more jovial than ever, with that said I'm anticipating the upcoming juncture.
