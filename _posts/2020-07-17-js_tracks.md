# Introduction

I wrote a test on JavaScript basics on the 16th of the 7th month, I never saw that test coming in that direction. I thought I was going to write about the whole of HTML_5 and CSS_3, but it was the opposite. The beating or a flog I got on that test was a build-up from the exposed weaknesses that were laid before me.
## The body

I guess the saying is true that often opportunities come as god guided opportunities brilliantly disguised as daily challenges and problems. The test showed me where to focus on when working with javaScript scripts, and I would like to take the honor to thank my mentor Mandla for giving me a test that required my undivided attention. Looking back I can see all of the dreams and visions I had priorly coming true before me. Truly speaking programming robots had always been my end goal.The dreams where too good to be true, but here I am having the privilege to code...
### Conclusion

Guess I was working hard, but not hard enough and I'm willing to push myself even further than this. Learning JavaScript and being comfortable with it is just another burier between me and my goal, I will never rest until I perfect my Craft and lean to the good side of all my oppositions like perfecting javaScript.A last thank you to my mentor for showing me where I leak.
