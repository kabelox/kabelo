# Introduction
As today is blog day I would like to blog about the awesome function that I coded today that returns "geometric" or "arithmetic" when arith or geo nums are passed in an array.
## The body
The following is the challenge that I commited to complete this morning :

function multiplyGetters(arr){
let num1Arith = new Set();
let num2Geo = new Set();

for(let i = 1; i < arr.length;i++){

let num1 = arr[i] - arr[i - 1];
let num2 = arr[i] / arr[i-1];

    num1Arith.add(num1);
    num2Geo.add(num2);
}

if(num1Arith.size === 1){
    return "Arithmetic";
}
if(num2Geo.size === 1){
    return "geometric"
}
return "nonsence"

}


// testers

console.log(multiplyGetters([2,4,6,8,10]));
console.log(multiplyGetters([2,4,8,16]));
console.log(multiplyGetters([1,4,7,8,13]));

### Conclusion

I would recommend most or every programmer to stick to the problem and conduct some internet research when the problem is quite complex and also consult some of his peers when things get too tough. As for me I rarely ask my peers of help when solving a problem because sometimes when you ask and always get what you want I think that the mentioned method might rob you of your learning progress because the more you fail and don't understand something the feeling of giving up or quitting might help you only when used properly. Trust me is not pride, but just being better at problem-solving.
