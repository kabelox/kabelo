# Introduction
Today my mentor gave me a test of creating a website that has hover javaScript functionalities and sound production. Did I fail?
## The body

My mentor gave us a 6-hour test and said we should complete a test that uses js functionalities like the likes of sound, and image slide effects. I was very excited about the test and I knew that I was going to succeed in it. I felt a soothing feeling of accomplishment in my heart and spent more than 4 hours planning my website and creating a js pattern functionality of how is my code going to be implemented.I was positive that I have completed my site, but the best of them all happened to me when my site was crushed at the end of the line. I debugged it and all worked but after pasting some of my pre HTML scripts and some stylings all went doom!



Only my CSS crushed when I reviewed my pages after submission and only a minor steps I left out, I felt like I was breaking into two and could not find another part of me. My cohorts laughed at me and celebrated my failure when they saw what my site was like after submission. They laughed at me only because I was the best student in my first-year class.

The feeling of betrayal after seeing their funny faces rushed in me and that has taught me one of the greatest lessons that are more valuable than ever experienced before. I realized that people will never forget your failures and when you succeed or do some good in most of the time they never recall that famous old saying is so true.

### Conclusion                      

I have committed a vow and I will never back down on it and it goes like this...I will never fail again starting from today, is either I learn or succeed and trust me when I say it. The pain of disappointment that I felt and that almost everyone around me wants to see me fall as they celebrate my downfalls!
Take it from me when I say never call yourself a looser you either learn to succeed. People never really understand the sacrifices that I make to keep up with coding and when I succeed I come to realize my hard work, but they want the glory and most are not willing to work as hard as I do, but when I fail a bit they laugh at me. I know that no one will care but my heart is broken. Let the games begin I'm ready to show my worth!

### side note
Today I learned about a new way to me to loop through an object, you heard me right looping through an object with the for-in loop, like this: for(let prop in an object) 
and the if statement with the object.hasOwnProperty(property).
