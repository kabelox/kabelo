    <p>I'm inlove with HTML and HTML 5,I also tried to deal with HTML 4.01 and XHTML versions,but they are 
        too strict whith specifying their doctypes and all of the tag rules are super strict and kind of 
        old outdated style so by now I wouldin't call my
         self a pro yet but i'm confident enough to say i'm a junior HTML 5 expect.</p>

        <p>Ass CSS3 before has been a drag to me before I began to really know the true and powerful meaning and representational skills the presentation of CSS really has,now i'm really
             working more on CSS than I work with HTML and now i'm inlove with both of CSS and HTML ,but web design is not what I want to specialize or major in,I love or would like
              to major in phython as my specialty.  </p>
