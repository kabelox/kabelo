# Introduction
Today was awesome, I also felt and smelled the atmosphere today was going to be a good one and indeed it was!
## The body

My mentor said we should try and build an app! wow, that was my moment, I have been waiting for this moment for a very long time and when my mentor mentioned it, I was so amazed that I jumped in and started coding at the very sec.



the app that I created was a music app more like SoundCloud if you follow.
It worked but required a lot of thinking and re-writing code every one and a half hours.

well enough of me yapping, so our topic of today is all tangled around the DOM or the document object model which is the only way in which HTML and javascript can inter-connect or else despite this axiom javascript and HTML should have not ever been so close cousins as they are these days.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

### Conclusion
Well an example of the dom could be something more like : <h1 id="demo">This is a Heading</h1>

<button type="button"
onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello World!'">Click Me!
</button>


I mean well this is just a bit of a spoiler, but there is more to this wonderful thing than the justs about it that I have just presented you with above.
