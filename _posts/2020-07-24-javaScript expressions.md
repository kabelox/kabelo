# Introduction
Regex or otherwise known as regular expressions are very good when form validating and during all of my research on how to learn them, FreecodeCamp came on top of the list.
## The body
Sometimes we tend to overlook opportunities we often get. I say this because before my mentor implicitly suggested me to be great at coding and take my daily tasks very seriously, I used to just complete my tasks as suggested without any real understanding of what I was doing or code challenges I came in contact with. A funny mentality switched when I was confronted to complete a certain challenge in freecodecamp to pass regular expression adversity or a regex challenge as most programmers call it.

The challenge was pretty difficult for me to complete and my cohorts were quite busy and I feared to interrupt them so I faced the challenge for a straight 1 hour troubleshooting till my head hurts and I tried until I passed the test, A tremendous thanks to the way the curriculum in Freecodecamp is set up because I can now say that I learned how to use regex as opposed to saying I can use regex expressions.
### Conclusion

I suggest that whoever completes freecodecamp challenges should not just complete them for the sake of completing the tasks or else it will backfire as it did to me priorly. I'm looking forward to doing a javascript project in the future to test how far I have gotten. Never take anything for granted regardless of the size or difficulty, that's was my lesson for this week.
