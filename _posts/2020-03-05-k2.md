# The day at the coding ground

Today and the beginning of this week was the week where I got to use the most of my right side of the brain
.Which is the side I'm mostly not perfect in expressing, I thought building a website was going to be a piece
of cake because since I'm pretty much confident in HTML5 and CSS3  because during the weeks when I was waiting for the TCG response I was reading the head-first HTML and CSS book. Being stuck on problems for hours
and trying by all means of delivering the solution, failing to create the web page I needed and the ability
of not being able to understand how the terminal and the git_hub process works has helped me a lot and
because the failures have exposed my weaknesses and revealed the areas that I need to improve to
draft and try to represent my first website as awesome as possible. After re-doing two websites today has shown
me how to be the better me and upgrading my web skills.
