#The feecode camp challenges

###The introduction
Monday, the 9th of march, this is the day where I got to push myself to the limits.working on free code camp till I could no longer take in.

###The body
Today I pushed myself to the limits, the limit that I have never been exposed in or with ever since I started 
using free code camp. I spent more than 6hours working on free code camp challenges, not just doing them and at
the part where you have to do your free code camp project you figure that you have not had yet grasped 
anything important or know how to deal with your projects without referring back to the very first or out-
dated topics.
###The conclusion
Spending extreme hours busy with free code camp challenges and watching free code camp tutorials at the 
side has exposed  me the fact that completing your challenges, watching tutorials and practically building
projects can give you the privilege of knowing and mastering your elements, selectors and syntax not
to also forget to mention your layouts.
