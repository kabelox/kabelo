# Introduction
I know I'm not the right guy to advise about best js practices since I'm also starting to get to know javaScript fundamentals...
## The body
So the truth is that I was completing JavaScript fundamentals at free code Camp and I was doing quite good during those times, and I was completing most of the challenges just to get done with them to excel into the next level. Well, I cannot deny the fact that I was having a feeling of gratification per completed challenge but I hate to break it down that all that I have done so far was for nothing. Today one of my great mentors gave us a test and the test was all about js fundamental and by the look of it, to me it felt like something I'm familiar with but at the same time, it felt like a challenge I never did nor faced.

So after writing the test I went to the internet and searched for why I was alienated with something I did earlier. What I have found is that I did not know the easy js fundamental any more because I was going too fast and just learning the things that I needed to know and never took time to elongate my knowledge on a certain topic and tackle more problems so what I was doing is what Elon Musk hated about a school system which was the downloading of algorithms into the human mind which is a very bad thing to do. So What I'm simply saying is that I was learning new things too much without enough practicing.

And the only way to be good at something is by practicing more and building stuff with the basics learned at each time. I support that statement because now as we speak I'm a master of html5 and css3 as far as I know. And now that I can create a clone of any static site and I only reached this level since I was building more projects and practicing my soft skills.
### Conclusion

I truly believe that I can do the same with JavaScript only if I practice more and slow down so that things that I learn each time can be engraved in my mind and be able to build awesome things without looking at any references.I'm busy reading the book called Eloquent js my mentor offered. This is showing me that I can be worth more than just speeding up and being in a hurry to land a first job.I'm a big fan of things that will come to you only if you are worth more and able to solve any js problems in a blink!. So that is my goal to be worth more and make it to the top 5 list of the best programmers in SA. I can only reach this goal if I work more and harder at a slow dent of a pace!
