# Introduction

Seems as if the days are locked in, during the whole weekend I couldn't think of anything better than to just be back at TCG, I wanted to finish with all of my work and the project given to me by one of my mentors Mandla. I was and still am eager to finish regardless because Theo once said that it doesn't matter what as long as he did what had to be done! the term "I do what has to be done " has been ringing in my head the whole time.

## body

Now I just got done with my calculator and my local storage and form not excluding my website. I mean everything is done and I'm just left with making my web and all responsive in mobile devices and some bit touch-ups. The only opposition that I'm facing now is the lack of electricity on my street and that is quite a pain and making my work progress very slow.

I aimed to finish everything in time so that I can start teaming up with my mentors and giving a hand in finishing projects and debugging their code. I can't wait to start my first apps

## conclusion

I'm looking forward to being marked and getting that 97-100% mark rate, and getting feedback via all the things I need to improve and be better at!
