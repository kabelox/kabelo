# The Introduction

I just wrote a  not so challanging test today and I'm glad I worte it because the most of the things on the test I have learned and practiced them before, I am not pretty solid about where did I learn nor practice those similar test questions. 

## The body

Our best active mentor Mr Mandla sent us a message on the chatting app during this week and he said one of the most stinging,but encouraging words when he said something like "We should not blame other people for our failures " something along those quoted words.
He reminded me of Jim Rhon one of the  once most successful and weilding sales person in the US of A.He also used to say  his mentor that transformed his bank balances used to tell him that the only way that he is not successful is because he has a lot of things to blame except himself and only if he can change that behaivour he will be where he aims to! 
    

That statement made me a better person and I thank him for that.Sorry for talking about my business,let's get to what I promised.
so : the split method or in an object mostly called a function is very helpful when it comes to turning a string to an array and and being flexible and creative with your array eg: function arr(str){
str.split(" ")
}
 
 arr("hello word")



### Trim 
the Trim method is very useful when it comes to taking out spaces between your stings or anywhere where you wish the spaces should be removed nor ignored.

### Join

The join method is the best usually after splitting strings in your array the join can help to present a well defined word or string.
please look into these and try them out they are very helpful

## Conclusion

The most important lesson from this blog is to never blame anyone ,but you if you want to succeed and be a better version of yourself.
There is a lot of people who are not willing to put in the work required only because they have a list of people or things to blame for their own failures.
My mentor has thought me a big deal.Even if  your are sick or not feeling ok.Don't quite in your dreams because you might be near. just know your spine is not broken yet and everting will be as  you plan and try to fail a lot and earlier so you still have time to get up and move forward!
