# Intro
The feel of terminal basic commands have added some super basic feel of the use of a terminal and made
my use of git and git_hub much easier.

## Body
Being able to know the basic commands have improved me from an amateur to a programmer, I feel a bit more
confident with using the bash terminal. The basics I learned where the ls command which simply means
to list whatever is in the folder that you are currently in.
The cd command which means change directory it helps with when trying to enter a directory or a folder
it also helps a lot when you want to return to the home space or folder. The mkdir which means to make
a directory and touch to create a file. the whatis command provides you with a description or a meaning
and use of a certain command that you don't know the meaning of.
when uploading or transporting a file using git bash to git_hub you can start with git status which shows you how is everything or it displays more like a page refresher, then use git add then the name of the
file you would like to add, click git commit -m'' between the inverted commas add a message you like to display
than last but not least push or add the git push command.

 ### Conclusion
 Being able to grasp all of these basic commands can make you feel more confident with your work as a day
 to day programmer and can make you outstand because you would be using your machine without touching 
 a mouse selector which will speed up your work-flow and those are the  awesome advantages of being able
 to use a terminal.
