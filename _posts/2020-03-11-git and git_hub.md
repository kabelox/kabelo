#The difference between Git and Git_hub

##Intro
Knowing the difference between git and git_hub is a very essential skill to brag about to your 
friends or co-partners when simplifying the workflow in building or working on projects as a team, since
two is better than one.

###The body
Today I got the privilege of getting to know the difference between Git and Git_hub. So what is Git,
Git is a VSC(visual system control) that is distributed, meaning by distributed is that it allows people
or developers to get to work together on a solo project and this relationship is not only locally it
also involves global partnership and helps developers to not override each other's source codes. This was
created in 2005 by the creator of Linux Linus Torvald to keep track of the changes he makes
on his source codes.

To put or allow other developers to have the ability to access your changes you need to 
push your changes in a repository called Git_hub, Bit_bucket or others.this will allow your partner to
pull the changes you made in the source code of the project built.Git_hub is more of a synching pathway
to allow access to each other's changes and do not forget that the git transport to the git_hub repository
you will need to know the git commands using a terminal.

####The Conclusion
All in all is that Git allows multiple personnel to work on a certain project even from country to 
country without overriding each other's code and keeping track of the changes made in your source code.
Git and Git_hub are very essential tools to have when working in a team because it makes the workload
much more out-lifted.
